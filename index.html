    <h2>Qualitative Accomplishments</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I am very detail oriented and very thourough and but it can cause me to get really caught up with the small things and take longer than I need to.</li>
            <li>I am also a bit of a perfectionist so I work really hard to acheive the goals I set but if something isn't working or going to plan I tend to start completely over.</li>
            <li> I am kind of an out of the box thinker so sometimes I can come up with good new solutions to problems but sometimes the ideas dont work out and I waste time on it.  </li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Quantitative Accomplishments</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>As a cashier I have helped thousands of customers.</li>
            <li>I got a 5 star review on my first day at my last job.</li>
            <li> I saved the company I worked for before that $2000 in asset losses by working with asset protection.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Passion Project</h2>
        <p>A passion project of mine is a table top game called Warhammer 40k. For this game you buy the pieces which are unassembled and unpainted, and in order to use them you have to put them together which allows some flexibility in how you do so. Kind of a mix and match sort of thing to customize your army. Once you have the pieces put together, you paint them and you really get what you put into it here. You have total contol over the appearance of your army. Once you are ready to play the game is when the logical thinking comes in. The game is very strategic and you need to try to plan ahead as many moves as you can, and one bad turn can change the tides of the game. Overall it is a multi-faceted hobby that is a lot of fun.</p>
    <h2>Golden Circles</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What?:</strong> Helping businesses and organizations with building websites in order to help them gain attention.</li>
            <li><strong>How?:</strong>Coding skills</li>
            <li><strong>Why?:</strong>To take care of people and help grow my community.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Path</h2>
        <p>I honestly believe I would enjoy both being an employee and being an entreprenuer, but I think I would prefer being an employee first so I can learn a little bit more from others and get experience in an actual work environment in the industry. </p>
      <h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
